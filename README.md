# Udacity - Big Data - Apache Spark

## Installation
The following was used for the environment setup:

- Python 3.5
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML

## Project Motivation
For a  fictional music streaming service (Sparkify), we are interested in seeing if we can predict which users are at risk of cancelling their service.  The goal is identify these users before they leave so they can hypothetically receive discounts and incentives to stay.

## File Descriptions
- Sparkify.ipynb - Notebook used for initial analysis / training.  Used a small subset (128MB) for this analysis.  When performed on the IBM platform, the entire dataset (12GB) will be used.
- README.md - The file you are reading now
